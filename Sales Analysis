customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.
product_id: Unique identifier for each product.

-> Calculating Total Revenue 

SELECT SUM(quantity * price) as revenue
FROM sales_transactions;

-> Top Selling Products

SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) as total_sales
FROM sales_transactions
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;

-> Top Customers

SELECT customer_id, SUM(quantity * price) as total_spent
FROM sales_transactions
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;

-> Monthly Sales Trends

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', date) as month, SUM(quantity * price) as revenue
FROM sales_transactions
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month ASC;

-> Yearly Sales Trends

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('year', date) as year, SUM(quantity * price) as revenue
FROM sales_transactions
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year ASC;
